We use Dell PowerEdge servers for our Appliances and specifications may sometimes changes due to limitations in availability for different parts and components. The numbers below are rough estimates.

### Standard

- Servers are equipped with dual 550 watts rated power supplies (Maximum output)
- With our current specification the calculated maximum potential power consumption should not be more than 260 watts.

### Large

- Servers are equipped with dual 750 watts rated power supplies (Maximum output)
- With our current specification the calculated maximum potential power consumption should not be more than 440 watts.

This page only covers the rough power-requirements and could be useful when doing basic sizing of your UPS. If you need more info when planning your infrastructure Dell has a Energy Smart Solution Advisor (ESSA) online and will calculate all info needed for our hardware at http://www.dell.com/calc
