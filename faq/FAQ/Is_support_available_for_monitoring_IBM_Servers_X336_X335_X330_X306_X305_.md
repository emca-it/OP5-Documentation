Yes, using client control of the OS. If you have an IBM Supervice adapter 2, you can perform a more advanced checks of hardware such as fans and temperature.

Another option is to use trapper forÂ receiving notifications and alarms from IBM Director and we have a documented setup if you use our OP5 Trapper Extension.
