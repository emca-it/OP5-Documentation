Are there any OP5 Monitor apps for Android or iPhone?

## Answer

* * * * *

Yes, the official OP5 Monitor app can be installed from *[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.op5.op5monitor&hl=en)* for Android and will shortly be available for IOS in the *Apple App Store.*
If you are using a different platform or an old version of OP5 Monitor you might still be able to use one of the unsupported legacy apps designed for Nagios, this is however *not* recommended for security reasons.
