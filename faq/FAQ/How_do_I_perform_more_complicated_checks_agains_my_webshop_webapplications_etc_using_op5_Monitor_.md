The [Monitoring websites with webinject](https://kb.op5.com/display/HOWTOs/Monitoring+websites+with+webinject) describes how this is done.

And Selenium can also be used for this and a knowledge base article describes [how this is done](https://kb.op5.com/display/DRAF/Selenium+in+Monitor)

We have readymade integrations with solutions provided by our partners as well for example Apica.
