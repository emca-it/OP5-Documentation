What are the plugins support levels?

## Answer

* * * * *

 

**High, Fully supported**

The plugin is continuously tested by op5. A fully compatible test environment for the plugin is in place to verify its functionality.

 

**Medium, Bug support**
 The plugin is not continuously tested by op5. op5 probably do not have a compatible test environment in place and/or resources to test the plugin. If an issue with the plugin is found, op5 will examine the importance and prioritize according to impact and level of effort. op5 monitors the upstream project (if any) and updates the shipped plugin regularly.
 **Low, Best effort**
 The plugin is shipped as a courtesy to op5 customers. Dependencies are resolved and the plugin is executed without runtime errors. The plugin has normally only been installed and tested at a customer site.
 op5 support helps out with command syntax.
