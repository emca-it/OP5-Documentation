# Why can't I Acknowledge problems from Nagstamon or my Android/iphone app?

## Question

* * * * *

Why can't I use the Acknowledge and Scheduled Downtime in [Nagstamon](https://kb.op5.com/display/AGENTS/Nagstamon+Desktop+Status+Agent) or my [Android](https://kb.op5.com/display/DRAF/Access+op5+Monitor+on+Android+Smartphone) or [Iphone](https://kb.op5.com/display/DRAF/Access+op5+Monitor+from+your+iPhone) app using the CGI's in /monitor.old/ in op5 Monitor 6.x?

## Answer

* * * * *

A security flaw was discovered in the Nagios CGI's, among them the functions for Acknowledge and Schedule Downtime which made unauthorized access to objects possible. Because of this op5 decided that these should be disabled to tighten the security of op5 Monitor.

It is still possible to view alarms and get notifications in Nagstamon and Iphone/Android apps.
