## Answer

Â 

Packetfront integration is comprised of 2 parts:

1. New, so called, asr machines which are configured in Packetfront's tool are automatically imported into Monitor.

2. A Packetfront plug-in which checks hardware status, temperature, power supply, etc. on Packetfront's machines.

Integration with other products. More information required in order to give a full answer.

What type of integration is required? Is Monitor to read the configuration from Oondoc, or should we send notifications and reports to Oondoc which are saved on the various systems? How can Oondoc distribute/receive the information which is to be exchanged.
