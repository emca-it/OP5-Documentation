If your web browser has the required plugins, you don't need to configure anything. These files will be played from a NagVis map:

/opt/monitor/op5/nagvis\_ls/share/userfiles/sounds/std\_critical.mp3
/opt/monitor/op5/nagvis\_ls/share/userfiles/sounds/std\_down.mp3
/opt/monitor/op5/nagvis\_ls/share/userfiles/sounds/std\_error.mp3
/opt/monitor/op5/nagvis\_ls/share/userfiles/sounds/std\_unreachable.mp3
/opt/monitor/op5/nagvis\_ls/share/userfiles/sounds/std\_warning.mp3
