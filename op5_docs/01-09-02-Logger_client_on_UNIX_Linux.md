# Logger client on UNIX/Linux

## Syslog configuration

Most UNIX and Linux systems have built-in support for system logging. This means you do not need to install any extra software to send your logs to *op5 Monitor*: both 'syslog-ng' and 'rsyslog' have ways to forward the logs they are already generating. We provide more information about configuring syslog application for remote logging can be found in our Logger clients section, linked here.
