# About

Macros can be used to a lot of things. It can for example be used for paths, passwords and retrieving information from OP5 Monitor.
You can read more about notification commands inÂ Notification macros in the Notifications chapter.

# Pre-defined macros

By default OP5 Monitor has a number pre-defined macros. All from path to plugin folder to retrieving information about the last state of service check.
 Below is a list of some macros a complete lite of macros can be found in the Naemon documentation: <http://www.naemon.org/documentation/usersguide/macrolist.html>

# Custom macros

It is possible to create your own macros. This can be used to store passwords or user names for example.
 All custom macros should be put in the file `/opt/monitor/etc/resource.cfg`
 A custom macro should use the `$USERn$` macro.
 To define a password for a check, first add the macro in `resource.cfg`

        # Password for vmware user
        $USER10$=secretpassw0rd

After that add the macro to check command, in this example we use the `check_esx3_host_cpu_usage` check command.

        command_name=check_esx3_host_cpu_usage    command_line=$USER1$/check_esx3 -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -u $ARG1$ -p $USER10$ -l cpu -s usage -w $ARG2 -c $ARG3$

This check will use the following macros:
 **\$HOSTADDRESS\$** - Will get the address of the host from the configuration
 **\$ARG1\$** - Use the fist argument from the check command.
 **\$USER10\$** - Use the argument specified in resources.cfg with the same name.
 **\$ARG2\$** - Use the second argument from the check command.
 **\$ARG3\$** - Use the third argument from the check command.
