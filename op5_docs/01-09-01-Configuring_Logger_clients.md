# Configuring Logger clients

## Introduction

*Logger* acts as a syslog server. This means any system with remote syslog capabilities can send its logs to your *OP5 Monitor* host for storage and analysis.

This chapter covers basic configuration of syslog clients on various platforms, such as *Microsoft Windows* and *Cisco IOS*. If your system or device is not listed in any of the included guides, please refer to the vendor's manual.
