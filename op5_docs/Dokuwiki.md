# About

op5 Monitor comes with an dokuwiki that gives you a great way to document both your environment and things related to your monitored systems.
Of course you can also use this dokuwiki to save other kind of related information in too. This makes it easy to reach and you will ensure you have all documentation in the same place.

# Formatting a wiki page

You can format your text by using wiki markup. This consists of normal characters like asterisks, single quotes or equal signs which have a special function in the wiki, sometimes depending on their position. For example, to format a word in italic, you include it in two pairs of single quotes like ''this''.

**Description**

**you type**

*Italic*

    //italic//

**Bold**

    *bold*

Underline

    _underline_

***Bold & Italic***

    *//bold & italic//*

Headings of different levels

    ==== Headline Level 3 ====  === Headline Level 4 ===  == Headline Level 5 == 

 Note:
 An article with 3 or more headings automatically creates a table of contents.
