# Installing\_syslog\_agent\_on\_windows

To make a Windows computer send its logs to your *OP5 Monitor* server, you have to download and install the *Windows Syslog Agent* from the [agent download page](https://www.op5.com/download-op5-monitor/agents/). *Windows Syslog Agent* sends the Windows Event Log content to the IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your *OP5 Monitor* system. It can also send plain text log files for applications that keep their own logs.

We provide the [manual for *Windows Syslog Agent*](https://kb.op5.com/display/DOC/Windows+SyslogAgent)in the agent installation section of the Admin Guide.
