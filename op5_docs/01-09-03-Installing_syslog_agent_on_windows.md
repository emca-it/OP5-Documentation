# Installing\_syslog\_agent\_on\_windows

To make a Windows computer send its logs to your *OP5 Monitor* server, you have to download and install the *Windows Syslog Agent* from the agent download page. *Windows Syslog Agent* sends the Windows Event Log content to the IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your *OP5 Monitor* system. It can also send plain text log files for applications that keep their own logs.

We provide the manual for *Windows Syslog Agent*in the agent installation section of the Admin Guide.
