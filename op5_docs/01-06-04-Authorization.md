# Authorization

## About

The authorization is set under **Group rights** under configuration.

## Group rights

Authorizations are only set on group(s). When an authorization point is hovered a tooltip will appear explaining what the setting does and the corresponding group and setting will be highlighted

### Expand/Contract authorization categories

The authorization categories are contracted by default. You can either choose to expand or contract all categories simultaneously by clicking the **Expand All** and **Contract All** buttons

 or expand or contract them individually by clicking the +/- sign underneath each category.

### Select/Deselect all rights

To select or de-select all the rights in a group of rights, for example "Host" check the checkbox below the group of rights that you would like to add or remove.

 The minus sign ![(minus)](images/icons/emoticons/forbidden.png) in the checkbox means that the group of rights is partially selected. Some rights in the group are checked.

### Lookup user

You can find out which groups a user is a member of by entering a username in the Lookup user text box and clicking the Lookup button.

 The groups that the user is a member will be highlighted and the authentication driver that they belong to will be indicated with an **X**.

 You will also get a list of additional groups the user is a member of underneath the Lookup user text box. An empty search string will hide the list and remove the highlights.

### Filter groups

By adding a filter text in the Filter groups text box and clicking Filter groups you can set a filter on the visible groups.

 Wildcard characters are neither supported nor needed. For example the filter strings "ad", "a" and "min" will all match a group called "admins".

 An empty filter string will reset the filter.

### Add, delete, rename groups

Renaming a group is done by typing a new name in the group name text box.

In the GUI you can create one new group each submit by filling the blank text box with the group name you want to create. To add a LDAP or Active Directory group type in the name of the group as it is named in your LDAP or Active Directory.
 Deletion of groups is done by removing the group name from the text box and leaving it blank when submitting your changes.

### Configuration files used by authorization

The file /etc/op5/auth\_groups.yml consists of all defined groups and their respective permissions.
 The GUI does not have to be used to edit authorization but we recommend that you use it to avoid syntax problems.
