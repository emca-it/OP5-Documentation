### Custom Columns

It is possible to create a custom column if the column isn't available from the standard columns.
 The format is "\<label\>" = \<data\> where \<data\> is the source of the data, for example if you would like to create a column that show the note of a host set in the configuration:
 "Notes" = notes

![](images/16482333/19235825.png) \


 It is also possible to fetch. For example the host notes on a service as well, by using the host.notes label.

### Links in custom columns

It is also possible to add HTML code into the column. Let's say that you have a note with an ID that corresponds to the system in your CMS database and you would like to create a link directly to that object. 

"Asset ID" = "\<a href=\\"http://inventory.example.org/?asset=" + notes + "\\"\>Asset " + notes + "\</a\>"

![](images/16482333/19235826.png) \


### Custom variables

To show a custom variable in a column use the format custom\_variable.\<VARIABLE\_NAME\>. The custom variable should be used without the underscore prefix. Using the same example as above, but this time we have the ID in a custom variable called **ASSETID**

"Asset ID" = "\<a href=\\"http://inventory.example.org/?asset=" + custom\_variables.ASSETID + "\\"\>Asset " + custom\_variables.ASSETID + "\</a\>"

### Sorting

To sort a column use click on the column. It is possible to sort columns ascending and descending.
