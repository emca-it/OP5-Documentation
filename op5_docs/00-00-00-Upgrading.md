OP5 Monitor is upgraded in the same way as the other OP5 products. If you have an OP Appliance system you can read about the upgrade procedure in the [OP5 Appliance system manual.](https://kb.op5.com/display/APSDOC)This chapter will only cover how to upgrade the application OP5 Monitor. We will learn how to upgrade two different ways:

-   -   Red Hat Enterprise Linux's 'yum' command
    -   Tarball files ('`*.tar.gz`') you may download from our Support site.

If you are upgrading from one main version to an other (eg. from version 6 to 7), you will need to use the tar.gz files found at our Support site. When upgrading over more than one main version (eg. from version 5 to 7), [please follow the Upgrade Guide on our Support site](https://kb.op5.com/x/BoIK).
