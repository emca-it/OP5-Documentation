# User Menus

## About

It is possible for an administrator to customize users menu.

This can be uses to limit the menu options for users that are not allowed to use certain parts of OP5 Monitor.

## Customizing

Full access users have complete control over what other user\_group have available in the OP5 menu.

\*\*Please be aware that menu's access is controlled at the user\_group level only, it is not possible to control on a user by user basis.\*\*
\*\* To make a user\_group available to edit the User Menu, the "Access Rights" in the "Misc" section of the groupright page must be unchecked. All other grouprights are allowed\*\*

You can follow the following procedure to edit the user menu for a user\_group.

1. Click on your user name in the top right of the OP5 GUI and click on "My Account" as shown in the below image.

4. Now we are where the magic can happen.
    This page will enable you to remove links and menus from the user\_groups GUI. Each option will hide that menu item when it is checked. You can hide an entire menu by selecting the main menu title, or select individual areas from a menu.
    Here is an image of what you will be seeing.
