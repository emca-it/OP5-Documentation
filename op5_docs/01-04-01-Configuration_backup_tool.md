# Configuration backup tool

## About

 The OP5 Monitor GUI has got a built-in configuration backup feature. This is not supposed to be a replacement to  [op5-backup](op5-backup)

The configuration backup is only backing up the OP5 Monitor configuration, nothing else.

## Backup/Restore actions

In the list of backups the first column is called **ACTIONS**. This is the functions you will find there, from the left to the right:

* View what files are included in the backup.
* Restore the backup
* Delete the backup.

## Backing up the configuration

1. Click Backup/Restore in the main menu.
