# **Introduction**

OP5 Monitor supports both agent-less and agent-based remote monitoring.

## Agent-less monitoring approaches

- [WMI](https://kb.op5.com/x/2oEK) – for Windows servers
- [check\_ssh](https://kb.op5.com/x/-gtS) – using SSH for Linux servers
- SNMPv3 – [XEN](https://kb.op5.com/x/joIK) and [KVM](https://kb.op5.com/x/jIIK) servers, as well as SNMP-capable networking equipment. Please refer to the [available SNMP plugins](https://kb.op5.com/x/2wtS).

OP5 recommends the following agent-based monitoring:

- Windows: [NSClient++](op5_NSClient++)
- Linux: [SNMPv3](https://kb.op5.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=14648365)

SNMPv3 offers secure authentication and encryption, and is very easy to configure. The net-snmpd SNMP agent is available in the default package repository for most Linux and UNIX-based operating systems. SNMPv3 also supports running existing NRPE plugins. Instructions on how to configure SNMP-based remote monitoring are available [here](https://kb.op5.com/x/LYTf).

NRPE had been the most popular agent for monitoring Linux servers. However, SNMPv3 provides far better security and ease of configuration. SNMPv3 can control a user via authentication and restrict that user to read-only activity, which makes monitoring less risky in secured environments. Nevertheless, NRPE is still available for organizations that have standardized their monitoring on it.
