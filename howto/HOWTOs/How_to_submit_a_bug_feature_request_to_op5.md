# How to submit a bug/feature request to op5

We have made our [issue tracker](https://jira.op5.com) public for users to access directly. This means that you can read almost anything about our development. Due to license costs, we're unable to receive bug reports, but we're happy to receive them through commercial [support](https://www.op5.com/services/support/) for customers or our [mailing list](http://lists.op5.com/mailman/listinfo/op5-users) for community users.

For details on how we work with reported bugs, please see [our bug handling process](http://www.op5.com/blog/blogs/op5-bug-handling-process/).

We can (and probably will) change some of the fields you report, to suit our needs. But don’t let that bring you down, we appreciate as accurate reports as possible!

**Priority Levels**

Here is the definition of priority levels used in Jira. Use these definitions when reporting new issues.

Priority Level

Description

Block

The problem affects all or a large part of customers (i.e. the problem manifests using a default or very common configuration) and the problem causes crash or data loss in core functionality (general check execution, notifications) and the problem occurs very frequently and no workaround exists
 In most cases we create a bugfix release for this type of problem, but we might release a customer-specific patch initially for faster delivery to affected customers.

Critical

The problem affects all or a large part of customers (i.e. the problem manifests using a default or very common configuration) and the problem causes crash or data loss in core functionality (general check execution, notifications) and the problem does not occur very frequently or workaround exists
 In most cases we create a bugfix release for this type of problem, but we might also release a customer-specific patch for faster delivery to affected customers.

Major

The problem affects all or a large part of customers (i.e. the problem manifests using a default or very common configuration) or the problem affects core functionality (general check execution, notifications). We do not normally create bugfix releases when this type of issue is fixed; the fix will be made available in the next minor release.

Minor

The level to use by default and used for the majority of reports

Trivial

Very small problems
