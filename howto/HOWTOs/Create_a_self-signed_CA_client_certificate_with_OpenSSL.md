### Generate CA key & certificate - fill out the information when asked for such as country & organization name.

openssl genrsa -out MyRootCA.key 2048
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key MyRootCA.key -sha256 -days 1024 -out MyRootCA.pem

### Generate client key & certificate signing request - fill out infoIMPORTANT: CN / Common Name should be the clients IP or FQDN

openssl genrsa -out MyClient1.key 2048
openssl req -new -key MyClient1.key -out MyClient1.csr

### Generate client certificate based on our own CA certificate

openssl x509 -req -in MyClient1.csr -CA MyRootCA.pem -CAkey MyRootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out MyClient1.pem -days 1024 -sha256
