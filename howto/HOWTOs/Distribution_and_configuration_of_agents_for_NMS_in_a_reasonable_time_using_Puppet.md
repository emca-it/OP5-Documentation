# Distribution and configuration of agents for NMS in a reasonable time using Puppet

This article presents a paper written by Robin Jonsson & Simon Blixt late 2013 describing how to automate agent distribution in large IT environments using Puppet. Please read the [published paper (attachment)](attachments/7176499/7471202.pdf) and also visit the [project-page on Github](https://github.com/jesajah/RoSi) hosting the files used in their study.

## Problem

How is it possible to simplify deployment of agents and management of services on monitored nodes in a mixed IT infrastructure in a reasonable time?

## Target Audience

This paper is addressed primarily for administrators and personnel working with Network Monitoring Systems like OP5 Monitor in large IT infrastructures. The paper could also be of interest for a reader involved or with an interest in system integration, deployment of software and how to simplify the distribution in a time efficient manner. Basic Unix / Linux server administration is recommended.

## About Puppet

Puppet is a Configuration Management System used to automate distribution of resource configurations across an IT infrastructure. Puppet makes it easy to automate functions which lead to simplified provision, configuration, and management of infrastructures throughout its lifecycle. Puppet can run either in a client-server or stand-alone mode. It has support for managing Unix, OSX, Linux and Windows platforms.
